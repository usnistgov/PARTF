This script assumes that all the configs and parameters in the Event and PMUImpair modules are up-to-date.  Also that the Event Module.ini script has been run or else both "GetEvtReports" and "GetEvtSignal" states will be called before the states in this script.  Note that no script found in .ini files should end with a "Stop" state since that is added when all .ini file scripts have been concatenated.
